Final Game Technology Report

Team: JJ Abrahams
Members: Mitchell Marshe and Benjamin Johnson

As of now, Mitchell is working on developing the framework of a game engine. He has implemented the following:
filesystem - a small script to figure out which operating system we are using in order to format file paths. 
lights - basic class that handles setting up lighting information to be loaded into shaders via uniforms.
loader - a wrapper library around Assimp to load in single trimesh .obj files and textures.
material - a basic struct to handle material data.
mesh - a basic struct to handle mesh data.
object - a class to handle loading, manipulating, and rendering .obj files. 

Meanwhile, Ben is working on the graphic's pipeline for adding in post-processing shaders. He has implemened the following:
Lens Flare - mirroring effect that a camera lens gives in high contrast lighting.
Blur - image bluring and blending.
Bloom - an effect where lights have a bright aura.

What's to be done in the future?
We need to refactor what we have so far to keep implementing new concepts. Our goal is to be able to create a simple scene,
where our player can snap photos of the world and do postprocessing effects. We also need to add in a gui and create a scoring
mechanic for taking a picture of certain objects.
